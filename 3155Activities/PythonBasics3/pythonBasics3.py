# Part A. ends_with_consonant(s)
# Define a function ends_with_consonant(s) that takes a string and returns true
# if it ends with a consonant and false otherwise.
# (For our purposes, a consonant is any letter other than A, E, I, O, U.)
# Note: Be sure to use RegEx and it works for both upper and lower case and for nonletters!

def ends_with_consonant(s):


  return




 # Part B. ends_with_number
# Define a function ends _with_number(s) that takes a string and returns true
# if it ends with a number and false otherwise.
# (For our purposes, a number is any character that is 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8, or 9.)
# Note: Be sure to use RegEx!
def ends_with_number(s):

  return


# Part C. binary_multiple_of_6
# define a method binary_multiple_of_4(s) that takes a string and returns true
# if the string represents a binary number that is a multiple of 6.
# Note: Be sure it returns false if the string is not a valid binary number!
# Hint: Use regular expressions to match for the pattern of a binary number that is a multiple of 6.
