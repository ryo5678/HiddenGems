# Python Activity

# Fill in the code for the functions below.
# The starter code for each function includes a 'return'
# which is just a placeholder for your code. Make sure to add what is going to be returned.



# Part A.  (count_threes) now needs to return the multiple of
# three that occurs the most in a string. For example, 0939639
# would return 9 since it appeared 3 times while the other multiple
# of three appeared less than that. You only need to worry about
# single digit multiples of 3 (3, 6, 9). You must use a
# dictionary to accomplish this.





def count_threes(n):
  # YOUR CODE HERE

  return


# Part B. longest_consecutive_repeating_char
#  now needs to account for the edge case where two characters have
#  the same consecutive repeat length. The return value should now be
#  a list containing all characters with the longest consecutive repeat.
#  For example, the longest_consecutive_repeating_char('aabbccd')
#  would return ['a', 'b', 'c'] (order doesn't matter). You must
#  use a dictionary to accomplish this
def longest_consecutive_repeating_char(s):
  # YOUR CODE HERE

  return


# Part C. is_palindrome
# Define a function is_palindrome(s) that takes a string s
# and returns whether or not that string is a palindrome.
# A palindrome is a string that reads the same backwards and
# forwards. Treat capital letters the same as lowercase ones
# and ignore spaces (i.e. case insensitive).
def is_palindrome(s):
  # YOUR CODE HERE

  return
